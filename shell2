1.Write a shell script to print below pattern
0
0 1
0 1 2
0 1 2 3

# Define the number of rows for the pattern
rows=4

# Outer loop for each row
for (( i=0; i<rows; i++ ))
do
  # Inner loop to print numbers in each row
  for (( j=0; j<=i; j++ ))
  do
    echo -n "$j "  # Print number without newline (-n option)
  done
  echo  # Move to the next line after each row
done

2..Write a shell script to compile all C files and delete those files
having errors.

# Loop through all .c files in the current directory
for file in *.c
do
  # Compile the file
  gcc "$file" -o "${file%.c}.out" 2> /dev/null

  # Check if the compilation was successful
  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Compilation error in $file. Deleting..."
    rm "$file"  # Remove the file if there was an error
  else
    echo "$file compiled successfully."
  fi
done

# Define the number of rows for the pattern
rows=4

# Loop through each row
for (( i=0; i<rows; i++ ))
do
  # Print leading spaces for alignment
  for (( j=i; j<rows-1; j++ ))
  do
    echo -n " "  # Print space without newline
  done

  # Print the numbers in the pattern
  for (( j=0; j<=i; j++ ))
  do
    # Calculate and print the value based on row index
    if (( i == 1 && j == 1 )); then
      echo -n "$(( i + 1 )) "  # For the second row's middle value
    else
      echo -n "$(( j + 1 )) "  # For other values
    fi
  done

  echo  # Move to the next line after each row
done
